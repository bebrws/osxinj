   * For example use args[0].readUtf8String() if the first argument is a pointer to a C string encoded as UTF-8.
   * It is also possible to modify arguments by assigning a NativePointer object to an element of this array.

   * However, do not use this to store function arguments across onEnter/onLeave, but instead
   * use "this" which is an object for keeping state local to an invocation.
